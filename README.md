# day-planner

This assignment is a day planner to create a schedule. When I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for that day. I view the time blocks for that day and each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When I click into a time block, I can enter an event. I can click the save button for that time block. The text for that event is saved in local storage. When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.
